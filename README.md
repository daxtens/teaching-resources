# Teaching Resources

My wife is a teacher, and sometimes I make demos for her. Here they are, in hopes someone else will find them useful.

So far there is one demo:

 + lines.html: a demonstration of `ax + by + c = 0` lines. There's a [live version](http://dja.ucc.asn.au) you can use in any modern web browser.

You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to use these in the classroom or anywhere else: see the LICENSE file for details.
